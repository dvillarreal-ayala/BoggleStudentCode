| Jan 6   |  1-2pm  | Started problem set. Written down ideas on how to start, including using BFS, DFS, and TSTs. Need to begin implementing code. |
| Jan 8   | 11-12pm |                        We went over possible implementations of DFS for the project. Put in the version of DFS shown in class |
